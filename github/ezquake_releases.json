    "body": "## ezQuake 3.6.6 Release Notes\r\n\r\n### Improvements:\r\n- RENDERER: Connect PEXT_TRANS (entity field `alpha`) to transparency of aliasmodels and brush models.\r\n- HUD: add hud_gun[2-8]_frame_hide. (@osm)\r\n- RULESET: Add \"smackdrive\". (@osm)\r\n- PROTOCOL: Support FTE_PEXT_COLOURMOD, for example colored spawn markers. (@dsvensson)\r\n- Support up to 65535 screenshots.\r\n- RENDERER: Add FXAA option (@dsvensson)\r\n- BUILD: Support Devuan linux distribution in build-linux.sh script\r\n- BUG: Do not crash when no opengl driver/library can successfully create an opengl context\r\n- CI: Unify GitHub Actions into single workflow, upload macOS releases and snapshots. (@dsvensson)\r\n- MEMORY: Hunk ergonomics, mappers (typically) can now inspect memory usage via `hunk_print` command.  (@dsvensson)\r\n- RENDERER: Add support for skywind, ported from IronWail (@dsvensson)\r\n- SECURITY: Prevent command concatenation in the qw url parser (@osm)\r\n- SECURITY: Add remote capabilities validation (@osm)\r\n- SECURITY: Prevent downloadable files from being executed (@osm)\r\n- Display the clock in +showscores during deathmatch gameplay (@osm)\r\n- Disable STAT_MATCHSTARTTIME sync if gameclock counts down (@osm)\r\n- HUD: Resurrect the turtle (@osm)\r\n- HASH: Fix incorrect node removal in Hash_Remove and Hash_RemoveKey (@osm)\r\n- LIGHTMAPS: The semi-new e5bgr9 lightmap format was added to ericw-tools early 2024, existed in FTE for years, now loads, initially as LDR. (@dsvensson)\r\n- UI: Add scoreboard settings (@osm)\r\n- UI: Add more userinfo (@osm)\r\n- UI: Add scr_scoreboard_showclock (@osm)\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- Remove seconds from the $dateiso macro (@osm)\r\n- Restrict exec, set_{calc,eval,ex,ex2}, and IPC (@osm)\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes:\r\n- PROTOCOL: Make FTE_PEXT_TRANS from 2013 actually work, originally half implemented. (@dsvensson).\r\n- SERVER: Fix loading of QVM on macOS. (@dsvensson)\r\n- SECURITY: Only pass server defined aliases through cbuf_svc (@osm)\r\n- CONSOLE: Fix buffer overflow (@dsvensson)\r\n- FOV: fix rare CalcFov+viewsize glitches (@hemostx)\r\n- RENDERER: Powerup shells weren't rendered with fog enabled. (@dsvensson)\r\n- RENDERER: Lightmaps for aliasmodels were broken when using high-res lightmaps (DECOUPLED_LM). (@dsvensson)\r\n- RENDERER: Lightmaps for classic renderer were cleared each frame when using modern renderer, expensive. (@dsvensson)\r\n- PROTOCOL: PEXT_MODELDBL was only half-implemented, didn't read short if U_MODEL was unset and U_FTE_MODELDBL set. (@dsvensson)\r\n\r\n### Build:\r\n- CI: Switch Windows builds to msvc to avoid gpl_maps.pk3 bug. (@dsvensson)\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\nClient side demos recorded onwards will be better aligned to the gameplay protocol to support extended attributes. Enough of PEXT_TRANS was implemented back in 2013 for alpha attribute to be read correctly (but will be rendered opaque if outdated), but if colormod is used, outdated clients will not be able to play the MVD/QTV stream. Outdated clients will also not be able to correctly ingest a MVD/QTV stream with the amount of models and entities the fully connected gameplay protocol supports. Those limits used to be simply cut off, corrupting the demo over time, but in practice these limits were rarely if ever surpassed with old content.\r\n\r\nAs ezQuake has incorrectly announced support for PEXT_TRANS since 2013, the server must identify faulty clients by revision. The cutoff of working alpha support if the client is named *ezQuake* is **7814**. Official builds always have a correct revision set, scuffed ones may have revision as 1, so make sure you're not using a shallow clone when building on your own, or build from the official release source tarball.\r\n\r\nIn practice this shouldn't be much of an issue given how many vulnerabilities lurk in older releases.",

`/vid_reload_auto` cvar controls automatic/manual.\r\n- Added `_draw` cvar on hud elements, to take space on-screen but not render content (also filters SP & MP games) (requests #619, #620)\r\n- Added

damage (on supported .mvd files & qtv streams)\r\n- `/scr_scoreboard_login_names` will replace player's name with login when it is sent by server\r\n- `/scr_scoreboard_login_flagfile` maps player flags to graphics to be shown next to player's name when they are logged in\r\n- `/scr_scoreboard_login_indicator` will be shown next to a player's name when they are logged in (if flag not available)\r\n- `/scr_scoreboard_login_color` controls the color of a player's name when they are logged in\r\n- `/scr_scoreboard_showflagstats` will force flag columns to be shown on scoreboard (for CTF - thanks to dsvensson)\r\n- `/set_ex2` command added, same functionality as `/set_ex` but doesn't resolve funchars - useful if script needs to compare value later (#428)\r\n- `/status` command will be ignored if an alias with the same name is found, use `/sv_status` instead (#532)\r\n- `/timedemo` commands show extra info at end to try and highlight stutter (measuring worst frametimes)\r\n- `/timedemo2` command renders demo in stop-motion at a particular fps\r\n- `/tp_poweruptextstyle` controls if `$colored_powerups` or `$colored_short_powerups` is used in internal reporting commands\r\n- `/tp_point` will show targets in priority order, if `/tp_pointpriorities` is enabled\r\n- `/v_dlightcolor` added - controls if being inside flashblend light affects palette by color of light\r\n- `/v_dlightcshiftpercent` added - controls strength of palette shift effect when inside flashblend light\r\n- `/v_dlightcshift` changed - now enum of when being inside flashblend light affects palette (requested by HangTime, #542)\r\n- `/vid_framebuffer_smooth` controls linear or nearest filtering (thanks to Calinou)\r\n- `/vid_framebuffer_sshotmode` controls if screenshot is of framebuffer or screen size\r\n- `/vid_framebuffer_multisample` controls multi-sampling level of the framebuffer (reported by Matrix, #367)\r\n- `/vid_hwgamma_fps` controls how frequency the gamma of the monitor will be set if hardware gamma is enabled\r\n- `/vid_reload` command to reload textures, rather than full `/vid_restart` (#602)\r\n- `/vid_reload_auto` controls if `/vid_reload` is automatically called when a cvar affecting texture load is changed\r\n- `-oldgamma` command line option to re-instate old `-gamma` behaviour\r\n- `-r-trace` command line option in debug build - writes out API calls for each frame to qw/trace/ directory (will kill fps, just for debugging)\r\n- `-r-verify` command line option in debug build - regularly downloads GL state from driver, for use with -r-trace\r\n- `-noatlas` command line option to stop the system building a 2D atlas at startup\r\n- `-r-nomultibind` command line option to disable calls to glBindTextures\r\n- `+qtv_delay` command, to be used with `/qtv_adjustbuffer 2`... pauses QTV stream.  When released, QTV buffer length set to length of buffer\r\n- `+fire_ar` command added, an anti-rollover `+fire` - experimental, should simplify weapon scripts\r\n- On startup, `default.cfg` is executed before config is loaded (nQuake's default.cfg will be ignored)\r\n- On startup (after `autoexec.cfg` executed), a `vid_restart`/`s_restart` will be issued if any latched variables were changed (#458)\r\n- GLSL gamma now supported in classic renderer\r\n- MVD player lerping is disabled at the point of a player being gibbed (reported by HangTime)\r\n- Player LG beams hidden during intermission (no more beams in screenshots)\r\n- ezQuake will re-calculate normals on shared vertices as model is loaded (bug in models with normals set per-surface)\r\n- When gameplay-related protocols are enabled but not supported by server, you will be warned during connection\r\n- IP addresses with 5-character TLDs are detected - fixes .world addresses (thanks to bogojoker)\r\n- Added hud element 'frametime', similar to fps but measuring (max) frametime\r\n- Changed file-handling when viewing demos from within .zip|.gz to reduce temporary files being left on hard drive\r\n- PNG warning messages now printed to console rather than stdout\r\n- Added macro $timestamp, which is in format YYYYMMDD-hhmm\r\n- Qizmo-compressed files can be played back using Qizmo on linux\r\n- When watching mvd/qtv, `/record` & `/stop` become `/mvdrecord` and `/mvdstop` respectively (suggested by HangTime)\r\n- Internal server has been updated to match latest mvdsv codebase\r\n- Removed chaticons limitation where source image had to be 256x256 pixels (#477, reported by timbergeron)\r\n- Demo signoff messages are no longer random\r\n- Multiview will be disabled when watching a solo demo and no powerup cams are active (requested by mmavova, #126)\r\n- qw:// urls in command line will be opened even if not preceded by `+qwurl` (thanks to ciscon)\r\n- Linux: `/register_qwurl_protocol` command will register protocol with xdg (thanks to ciscon)\r\n- Commands that search by regular expression (`/cvarlist_re` etc) are now case-insensitive (reported by HangTime, #599)\r\n- Added support for MacOS qw urls opening via drag and drop emulation (thanks to ciscon)\r\n- Improved alignment of scoreboard scores, removed teamkills in teamplay 4 (thanks to dsvensson)\r\n- Will now load from `ID1` folder if `id1` not present\r\n- Will now check PAKx.PAK if pakx.pak not present (fixes #637, reported by nzmyers)\r\n- Skyboxes rotated to match other quake engines (part of #629, requested by inf1niti & lurq)\r\n- Skyboxes will be loaded on map start if specified in worldspawn (fixes #629, requested by inf1niti & lurq)\r\n\r\n### Build/meta\r\n\r\n- Uses libsndfile to load .wav files, if available (if using version < 1.025, set OLD_WAV_LOADING=1 during build to use old custom .wav-loading)\r\n- Duplicate declarations fixed (supports -fno-common, reported by ciscon)\r\n- Updated Azure Pipelines builds to latest ubuntu/macos\r\n- Visual Studio project, Azure Pipelines builds windows binaries (64-bit binaries are VERY beta, not recommended)\r\n- meson build updated (out of date on 3.5)\r\n- Fixed build on FreeBSD/powerpc64 (thanks to pkubaj)\r\n- Remove unsupported 666-deflect message from fragfile.dat (reported by eb, #461)\r\n- Support building on NetBSD (thanks to ciscon)\r\n- Lots of help/manual updates (thanks to various, but especially hemostx)\r\n- Added arch-linux support to `build_linux.sh` script (thanks to ginzberg)\r\n- Changed endian detection in GCC/clang (fixes #655, thanks to ciscon)\r\n"

    "body": "## Changelist from 3.1 > 3.2\r\n\r\nMost development effort in the past few years has centred on the renderer update (3.5) so 3.2's changes are relatively small and mainly focused on bugfixes & demo playback.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- Windows static libary: SDL upgraded from 2.0.5 => SDL 2.0.8 (WASAPI sound by default)\r\n- Windows static libary: zlib upgraded from 1.2.8 => 1.2.11\r\n- Windows static libary: libcurl upgraded from 7.37.1 => 7.61.0\r\n- Windows static libary: expat upgraded from 2.1.0 => 2.2.6\r\n- Windows static libary: jansson upgraded from 2.7.0 => 2.11\r\n- `mvd_moreinfo` improvements (older servers/demos, still does a lot of guesswork)\r\n  - only print location name on pickup announcements when more than one item on the map\r\n  - list location of items if > 1 of that item on the map\r\n  - if raw item name is in location name, only print location name when announcing item pickups\r\n  - announces when the pickup is from a pack, rather than the item\r\n  - location of item is stored when simple clock entries are added\r\n  - store location of megas as players pick them up (maximum 4 megas)\r\n- `itemsclock` improvements (requires server to be running KTX 1.38+)\r\n  - if KTX pickup/drop/spawn notifications are available they will be used (accurate, no .mvd guessing)\r\n  - items-clock can have fixed entries for each major item on the map\r\n  - items-clock can be filled with entries as match starts (`/mvd_autoadd`)\r\n  - user can assign name major items on the map or remove (`/mvd_name_item`, `/mvd_remove_item`)\r\n  - trigger `f_demomatchstart` fired at match start\r\n  - `/mvd_list_items` will generate example list of items for config file generation\r\n  - `hud_itemsclock_style 5`: lists backpacks, a space then items, in format \"`itemname` : `info`\"\r\n  - backpacks can be added to the items list (`/hud_itemsclock_backpacks`), will be listed with the person who dropped the pack and who picked it up before disappearing\r\n- In-game backpacks can be colored according to their contents (`/gl_custom_rlpack_color`, `/gl_custom_lgpack_color`) (QTV/MVD only, KTX 1.38+ only)\r\n- Failed [ServeMe] connections will be removed from the playerlist (caused by `nospecs`)\r\n- Teaminfo hud element can include frags (%f/%F)\r\n- In KTX race mode, other players can be silenced with `/s_silent_racing` cvar\r\n- Added macros $team1 & $team2 to access the first two teams on the server (#256)\r\n- Demo capture can produce animated .png files (`/sshot_format apng`)\r\n- `/ignore` can now contain a regular expression\r\n- `f_qtvfinalscores` trigger fired when `//finalscores` notification detected in qtv stream\r\n- `/cl_mvinset` position & size can be set by user (`/cl_mvinset_size_x` sets relative size compared to screen)\r\n- `/r_lerpframes` is no longer disabled when using multiview\r\n- Team fortress grenade models should be flagged as grenades now (`/gl_custom_grenade_color` etc should work)\r\n\r\n### Ruleset changes\r\n\r\n- `thunderdome` allows simple-item backpacks & texture replacements for backpacks\r\n- `thunderdome`, `smackdown` & `qcon` all block hud group-picture changes during the match\r\n- `thunderdome`, `smackdown` & `qcon` all block `/gl_outline` as it can lead to seeing items & players through walls\r\n- `r_skincolormode`, `r_enemyskincolor`, `r_teamskincolor` blocked in TF games or if server blocks skin/color forcing\r\n- Team Fortress: scoreboard always color players by their teamname\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Loading a single player save file on 64-bit systems may cause crash shortly after resuming play (#297)\r\n- Dynamic lights correctly set during .dem playback (#298)\r\n- When viewing pre-selected weapon, the weapon only switches once the animation frame goes back to non-firing (#182)\r\n- `/r_viewmodellastfired` no longer shows last-fired weapon when starting match, moving to a new map or dying while not firing\r\n- QTV URLs can now include the QTV password (must have '/' separating command and password) (#295)\r\n- Gamma on screenshots was incorrect when system had more than 256 gamma ramps (linux) (#296)\r\n- BSP2 maps: fix crash when turb surfaces outside -9999/+9999 bounds (#323)\r\n- `/ignore $name` (allow the player to ignore their own messages) produced output during certain teamplay messages (#257)\r\n- `/in_raw 0` - mouse input fixed (#308)\r\n- `/scr_cursor_sensitivity` is now functional again\r\n- Toggling multiview with inset window should alway keeps the current player in the primary view\r\n- Multiview was trying to cause increase in frames rendered (`/cl_maxfps` multiplied for each extra view)\r\n- Multiview inset window border now correctly set regardless of console:screen ratio\r\n- `/mvd_moreinfo` - multiple bugfixes\r\n  - fix incorrect location name when reporting item pickups\r\n  - pack drops are announced when the player dies, not when they respawn\r\n  - weapon dropped now based on active weapon when dying, not last weapon fired\r\n  - {} white-text wasn't stripped from item name cvars\r\n- Halflife maps had wrong bounding box sizes\r\n- `hud_sortrules_includeself 0` could lead to player not being included in visible list\r\n- `aliasedit` could result in the end of previously entered text to appear at end of line\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Removed functionality to control external MP3 player through ezQuake\r\n\r\n### Build/meta changes\r\n\r\n- OSX: Dialog to find .pak files on initial installation could point to 'my computer' location on Mojave\r\n- Added azure-pipelines.yml\r\n- Server: can now be built without USE_PR2 defined\r\n- .exe exports fields that AMD/nvidia drivers can use to always use accelerated graphics\r\n"

    "body": "## Changes in 3.0.1\n\n### Rulesets\n- Allowing alternate player models now determined by ruleset\n- Ruleset qcon reports the new player model (CapNBubs) as modified\n- Changing ruleset or `/allow_scripts` now releases all protected keys.  Blocks `/cl_idrive` workaround.\n\n### Input\n- Added `/con_toggle_deadkey` cvar as a workaround for SDL2 deadkey-handling.  Should stop first character typed at the console being corrupt when using a keyboard layout where the console toggle key is also an operating system deadkey.\n- Bugfix: keyboard operating system layout is used if the program is started and `/cl_onload` is set to a console command (was previously set to QWERTY until game started).\n- Bugfix: `/cl_keypad` cvar operational again, if set (default) then keypad & basic number keys can be bound independently.  If turned off, keypad keys converted to standard keys, bindable as per QWCL.\n\n### Display\n- `/gl_loadlitfiles` now controls loading of all colored lighting, regardless if from .lit file or stored in the .bsp file.  Hidden cvar `/gl_noinlinergb` removed.\n- Bugfix: horizontal fov was being increased when `/viewsize` caused effective aspect ratio to change.  `/scr_fovmode` cvar controls how ezquake keeps the fov correct.\n  - `/scr_fovmode 0` (default) will use the aspect ratio of the monitor and then crop the image vertically.  This matches the approach taken in QWCL\n  - `/scr_fovmode 1` will introduce horizontal letterboxing to keep the aspect ratio constant.\n\n### Menu\n- Ruleset qcon now available through menu\n- Sound: desired samples available through menu\n- \"Light Mode\" renamed to \"Darken Map\"\n- Bugfix: F2-F12 are now bindable in menu\n- Bugfix: When unbinding through menu, only keys that match the command are unbound (rather than all keys starting with the corresponding command)\n\n### Other\n- Various documentation corrections and updates.\n- Bugfix: Various memory leaks patched\n- Bugfix: `/playdemo <longfilename>` could crash client\n- Bugfix: console background resizes as console width/height changes.\n- Bugfix: ambient sound would not change volume if cl_maxfps was sufficiently high (leads to ambient sounds always playing or never playing)\n- Bugfix: on Linux systems, keyboard input will be grabbed as well as mouse when `/in_grab_windowed_mouse` set.  Should stop window manager shortcuts from firing during game.\n- Bugfix: `/connectbr` will default to port 27500 if no port specified\n- Bugfix: No longer looks for files in root of the current drive if `/userdir` is empty\n\n### Build environment\n- Windows: can now access https:// server browser sources (libcurl library updated)\n- OSX: binary should now be compatible with OSX 10.9\n"

    "body": "## Changes in 3.0\n\n### General\n- Major overhaul of backend code - now using SDL2 library for all three platforms.  Linux & OSX versions in particular are now much improved.\n- Now use 4:3 `/fov` value and ezQuake will adjust for your resolution\n- Added `/ruleset thunderdome`, a less restrictive version of smackdown\n  - Advanced particle effects are allowed in-game\n  - `/cl_rollalpha` is enabled, allowing `cl_rollangle` to tilt opponents in the direction they are moving, but not the current player\n- Added `/ruleset qcon`, a more restrictive version of smackdown for tournament play\n  - `/play` & `/playvol` commands are disabled\n  - MP3 player is disabled\n  - `/gl_outline` is disabled\n  - `/gl_brush_polygonoffset` is disabled\n  - A hard limit of 10 sequential wait commands\n  - Hud images cannot be changed during the game\n- Added AFK status on scoreboard (see `/scr_scoreboard_afk` and `/scr_scoreboard_afk_style`)\n- Added support for 'new' player model by CapnBub (passes f_modified)\n- Added `/gender` to control gender of player in messages.  Requires server support for streak messages to be correct\n- Added `/con_fragmessages 2` option to show frag messages in the console, but not in the notification area\n- Added `/con_mm2_only` option to hide all messages which are not mm2 (`/say_team`) from the notification area during game\n- Added `/lg_color` command & `/gl_custom_lg_color_enabled` to allow lg bolt color to be set without replacing texture\n- Added ability for all mm2 codes to have fixed widths and alignments set.  For example `/say_team %<10r>l` will print the player location, but fixed-width 10 characters, aligned right.  Defaults can be set by (e.g.) `/set tp_length_l 10; /set tp_align_l r`\n- Added `/tp_tooktimeout` & `/tp_pointtimeout` to customise time before last taken/pointed item is blanked\n- Added `/cl_textencoding` to control outgoing formatting of unicode characters.  FTE's ^U encoding now supported\n- Added `/hud_score_bar` options to allow player/team names to stay in the same order, regardless of current tracked player\n- Bugfix: server browser should be more stable\n- Bugfix: scoreboard would not appear in auto-screenshot if console was down at match end\n- Bugfix: `/cl_delay_packet` could cause packet loss\n- Bugfix: extended uptime led to jerky player prediction\n- Bugfix: starting client direct from qw:// url could lead to viewsize, fakeshaft having incorrect settings\n- Bugfix: where chat icons & player identifications were shown during intermission\n- Bugfix-ish: `/setinfo rsnd 0` causing item pickups to not be detected... not fixed, but should happen less often\n- Removed `/vid_wideaspect`\n\n### Input\n- Added `/in_raw` to enable raw input (enabled by default).  Replaces `/in_mouse` input selection method.\n- Added `/sys_inactivesound 2`, will play sounds when out of focus but not minimised\n- Added `/in_release_mouse_modes`, controls when the mouse cursor is released by the application when in windowed mode\n- Added `/m_accel_power`, `/m_accel_senscap`, `/m_accel_offset` - mouse acceleration now uses [povohat's method](http://www.quakeworld.nu/forum/topic/6488)\n- `/sys_disableWinKeys` now releases its lock on alt-tab, and re-establishes when switching back.\n- Now uses operating system keyboard layout by default.  `/in_builtinkeymap 1` switches back to Quake/American default\n- Removed `/m_showrate`\n\n### Audio\n- Lower latency audio - audio is now mixed in its own thread\n- Added `/s_desired_samples` to suggest a buffersize to audio thread\n- Added `/s_listdrivers` to print supported sound drivers (SDL information)\n- Added `/s_audiodevice` to choose which audio device to use (`/s_audiodevicelist` gives list)\n- Removed `/s_mixahead`\n\n### Video settings\n- Added `/vid_usedesktopres` to tell client to run at desktop resolution (enabled by default).\n- Added `/sys_disable_alt_enter` to block alt-enter toggling fullscreen (disabled by default)\n- Added `/vid_conscale` to scale screen resolution by constant if `/vid_conwidth` or `/vid_conheight` are zero\n- Added `/vid_displaynumber` to set which display to run on when fullscreen\n- Added `/vid_win_displaynumber`, `/vid_win_width`, `/vid_win_height` - windowed equivalents of fullscreen settings\n- Added `/vid_win_save_pos`, `/vid_win_save_size` to set cvars when window moved/resized by operating system events\n- Added `/vid_24bit_depth` toggles using 24-bit z-buffer (enabled by default)\n- Removed `/vid_mode`, `/vid_customwidth`, `/vid_customheight`\n\n### QTV\n- Added `/qtv`: `/qtv <server>` will spectate `<server>` via QTV (requires that server is listed on [QTV website](http://qtv.quakeworld.nu))\n- Added `/find`: `/find <name>` will return all players matching `<name>` (requires that server is listed on [QTV website](http://qtv.quakeworld.nu))\n- Added `/qtv_fixuser` to allows corrupt player userinfo strings from older versions of QTV to be corrected\n- When spectating via QTV, `/join` command will connect you to the server\n- Bugfix: muzzle flashes no longer appear in incorrect positions\n- Bugfix: stop `/cl_demospeed` from causing frozen explosion effects (can re-enable with `/qtv_allow_pause`)\n\n### Demo playback\n- New hud element 'static_text'.  Enabled only when spectating, allows custom, multi-line text area on screen\n- Added support for playback of .qwd demos from QW 2.1 and up (protocol versions 24/25)\n- Added `/cl_demoteamplay` to let you view standard QW `+showteamscores` when watching NQ (.dem) demos.  Players with -99 frags will appear as spectators\n- Bugfix: `/demo_jump` - works on .dem files, doesn't break prediction of players in .qwd files\n- Bugfix: `/playdemo x.mvd` will not attempt to play x.qwd then x.mvd\n- Bugfix: `/demo_capture_max_vid_len` allows splitting of .avi into multiple files, rather than producing corrupt .avi file due to limits of the format\n- Bugfix: `/cam_pos` now stops tracking player.\n- Bugfix: `/demo_jump` doesn't lose free-floating camera position during a rewind\n- Bugfix: .dem playback - player colors, particle trails, textures, third-person cameras and .lit files should work as normal.\n- Bugfix: .qwd playback - player prediction enabled, should be much smoother\n- Bugfix: scoreboard now obeys `/teamlock` (current player can have enemy color)\n\n### Other\n- Console variables can have \"auto\" values supplied, so the user can see the value being used by the engine rather than just the default values & currently set\n- Added `/con_bindphysical` to toggle `/bind <key>` interpretting `<key>` as based on operating system or Quake layout.  Defaults to 1 at start of every configuration file and is reset at end.\n- Added `/f_focusgained` trigger\n- Added `/batteryinfo` command\n- Upper limit of 10 seconds on console notification times.\n- When searching for textures, precedence given to individual files over those found in .pak or .pk3 files\n- Can associate client directly with URLs in browser (i.e. `ezquake-gl.exe qw://<serverip>`)\n- Command and variable documentation is now compiled into the executable\n- Single makefile to make all platforms\n- Scripts to build using Travis CI and Docker\n- Removed: plugin system, software renderer, assembly code, security module, TCL scripting, FTE2 voice chat\n"
